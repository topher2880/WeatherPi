# WeatherPi

Original coding by Switchdoc Labs

This is a quick setup from Raspbian for all the depends and things required to run the SDL weather pi hardware with little hassle.

We assume you have already installed Raspbian or Raspbian Lite from N00bs and therefore have Python installed, even the bare essentials.

The python script for setting everything up is a work-in-progress, and dont expect it to work, ever.

to run;
sudo git clone https://github.com/topher2880/WeatherPi 
cd WeatherPi
sudo python setup.py
